"""Realtime envelope construction and validation.

An envelope is a HINT — "something about resource X changed" — never data. The
rules below mirror ``crm-backend/src/shared/realtime/realtime.envelope.ts``,
which re-validates everything on the way out to a browser:

* **No business data.** No names, emails, EANs, amounts, invoice numbers,
  storage keys, error messages.
* **No display strings.** Toast text is chosen client-side from ``topic`` +
  ``hint["status"]`` against the i18n bundle. This is a security control: a
  compromised publisher gets a nuisance channel, never a text-injection channel
  into every open browser.
* **No recipient field.** The channel already says who. A recipient in the body
  invites a subscriber-side "is this for me?" check — authorization on the wrong
  leg.

``ref.id`` is permitted: any authorized reader can already see it, and the
client needs it to decide *which* row to refetch.
