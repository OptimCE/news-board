    Sets ContextVars from the KrakenD-forwarded headers so that services,
    repositories, and audit logging can read them without passing UserContext
    explicitly.

    Role resolution mirrors crm-backend's ``shared/middlewares/context.ts``: the
    gateway injects ``x-user-orgs`` as a blob of *all* the caller's orgs and their
    roles (``[orgId:… orgPath:/x roles:[ADMIN]],map[orgId:… …]``). The effective
    role is the one attached to the org whose ``orgId`` equals the active
    ``x-community-id`` — not the raw blob. ``require_min_role`` reads the resolved
    single role from ``current_user_role``.
